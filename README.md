# Smart-Road-Safety-Assistant
Smart Road  Safety Assistant project is an Android app-based project about identifying traffic rule-violating activities- wrong-direction driving, unauthorized lane usage. Also, the app will be able to capture a photo of those violations with a detected bounding box on the pictures.
